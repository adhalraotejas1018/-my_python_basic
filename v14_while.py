# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
#lets see the syntax of while loops
#its run until reached condition
#printing the number 1 to 10

print("\n1-----------printing 1 to 10")
i=1
while (i<11):
    print(i,end=" ")
    i=i+1


#this loop doest stop becasue condition always true
# while True:
#     print("hii")

#this loops doest run because condition is false
# while False:
#     print("bye")
